# jmod-nick
An addon to stock JMod to add some missing (in my opinion) features and to implement the features I suggested before

Current items listed below
# HE Grenade
A cylindrical grenade with a fuse of 1.5s to guarantee a quick kill. Deals 300 damage and easily penetrates armor, radius of 256 units

# Fuel Air Grenade
The thermobaric bomb but as a grenade, there's nothing to add to it except the fact that fuse times are random each time.

# BB Grenade
A grenade that throws shrapnel with no damage and has a very small explosion and still no damage. Still works as a decoy grenade, scaring away NPCs and players that get PTSD on the first sight of a grenade, 3 second fuse

# Toxic Gas Grenade

The smoke grenade modified to release a chemical agent when primed. Has no fuse time and will release the toxin the moment you let go of the spoon, so use it wisely
